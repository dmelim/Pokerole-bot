# Pokerole-bot
A discord bot helper for Pokerole RP.

This is a discord bot built in JavaScript. The purpose of it is to help in a [Pok√©role Project](https://www.pokeroleproject.com/) campaign. 

To run the JS files use NodeJS. You need to create a dotenv file (.env) and store some private information. To understand it better I suggest this [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-discord-bot-with-javascript-nodejs/). For a more [up-to-date tutorial](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin), it's the official guide for discord.js. 

Run the deploy commands file once, and the main.js every time you want to run the bot on your nodeJS server, it will keep on running, till you close it.
